# `block(){:jsx}`

**Syntax:** `block((props) => vnode){:jsx}`\
**Example:** `block((props) => <div>{props.foo}</div>){:jsx}`

Million.js is a library that enables you to create _blocks_. A block is a special [Higher Order Component (HOC)](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) that can be used as a React component but is hyper-optimized for rendering speed.

Blocks are essentially components wrapped by `block(){:jsx}`.

```jsx
import { block } from 'million/react';

const LionBlock = block(function Lion() {
  return <img src="https://million.dev/lion.svg" />;
});

export default LionBlock;
```

<Callout type="warning">
  There are some limitations to using blocks. Please reference the [Rules of
  Blocks](/docs/rules) for more information.
</Callout>

## Hydration mismatch

If you are using Million.js on the server, you may encounter a hydration mismatch error. This is because Million.js uses a different algorithm for rendering on the server than it does on the client. To fix this, you can disable SSR.

```jsx
const NoSSRBlock = block(
  function NoSSR() {
    return <div>{Math.random()}</div>;
  },
  { ssr: false },
);
```
