# Usage with Typescript

If your project uses TypeScript, you may want to make your components type-safe.

<Callout type="warning">
  You must make your Props use `type` instead of `interface`, as this is the
  [officially recognized
  behavior](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/15300#issuecomment-332366024)
  by the Typescript team. Alternatively, if you want to use interfaces you can
  add `[key: string]: any` as per [this Stack Overflow
  comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37006008/typescript-index-signature-is-missing-in-type/65473225#65473225).
</Callout>

```jsx
type Props = {
  name: string,
};

const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ name }) => {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
};
const MyBlock = block(MyComponent);
```
